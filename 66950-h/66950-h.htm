<h2><a name="ADVERTISEMENT" id="ADVERTISEMENT"></a>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>

<p class="nind"><i><span class="smcap">The</span> Author of the Goblin Groom can, on no consideration, be induced to
follow the example of the amiable and justly celebrated Madame de
Genlis, who, in her Historical Romance of the Chevaliers du Cygne,
observes,&mdash;“Enfin l’ideè de faire mourir l’heroine de l’histoire des les
premieres pages, et cependant de s’occuper d’elle jusqu’ a la fin, est
peutetre assez neuve pour meriter quelqu’ indulgence.” Could he, on the
contrary, prolong the precious life of his exalted hero, but for a
single day, he should feel more real delight, than the indulgence due to
the most afflicting novelty can possibly confer. But though unable to
guard him from the blow, which the unrelenting hand of time must one day
inflict, the author can at least promise, if he shall himself survive
the catastrophe, to restore him to the respectful consideration of his
readers, in a form at once congenial to the spirit of poetry, and
suitable to the taste and temper of the times. To some of his readers,
it may be necessary to remark, which must readily occur to the attention
of the critic, that his true hero is only to be discovered, by the
frequent allusions to his high rank and acknowledged virtues; and having
thus divested the Goblin of the precedency, which he might otherwise
appear to have usurped, it now only remains to give his readers a
general idea of the story. It turns on the several incidents of a
fox-chace, but is called a Tale of Dunse, because in that favourite</i>
<small>RENDEZVOUS</small> <i>of the lovers of the chace, the Goblin first made his
appearance. That the minds of his readers may be as perfectly prepared,
as he could wish, for the manners of the age in which it is laid, he
apprizes them, that the poem opens on the last day of April 1806, and
concludes with the death of a fox on Flodden Field twenty-four hours
thereafter. The country over which he has accompanied his elfin fay and
merry pack, he has viewed with the rapid glance of a sportsman, and
therefore trusts, that his hasty and imperfect sketch will not be
regarded with the too scrupulous eye of rigid criticism. With all its
faults, but without further apology, he commits it to its fate, and,
notwithstanding the protecting influence of wire-wove,&mdash;broad
margin,&mdash;high price,&mdash;and hot-press, he is not without feeling some
apprehensions concerning its success.</i></p>

<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Walter</span>, at last, in order due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The minstrel tunes his harp to you;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very notes of friendship dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are cordial to a poet’s ear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then why, my Walter, should I care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From whence you come, or who you are.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What! tho’ no royal blood should flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thro’ veins of blue and breast of snow:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tho’ lowest of the low you be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still you shall hear my minstrelsy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough to me it is that you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are vassal to the bold B&mdash; &mdash;h;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For to my heart they still are dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who serve that stout, that valiant peer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now, my friend, ’tis right to ask,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How thrives your culinary task?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems it to me the cultured soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should glow beneath your sun-burnt toil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see thy face with ruddy glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smile on the rising cabbage row;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, methinks, I feel thy glee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I, my friend, can feel like thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E’en at the peeping of a pea;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_5" id="page_5">{5}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just when the germ has broke the soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very sight repays thy toil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, Cultivation! Ceres’ child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foe to the hill and desert wild!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foe to the mountain and the moor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friend to the hungry and the poor!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let me not, with thoughts elate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forget my Walter’s garden gate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the gates so wonderous fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here round the princely dwelling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Watty’s gate, beyond compare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these is far excelling!<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I forgot the garden fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sought the barren mountain bare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">O’er Tiviot’s hills, I bent my way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgetful of my minstrel lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor thought I much of this or that,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till fancy painted Marrowfat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She painted Walter as I’ve seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When weeding D&mdash; &mdash;h’s walks so green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To noble dames, just bent to bow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dejected head, erected hoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaimed respect to ladye fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shewed her that defence was there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas diffidence and manly pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bows, yet shews the power to chide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the common height of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Walter stands at least a span:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A brow of jet, a fiery eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like planet in a sable sky,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone from my fancy’s painted chief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, to give the scene relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A nose projecting curvedly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nose befitting well the eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vails it not me, alas! to speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bushy lip, or cherry cheek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To say I saw my Walter smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’d rather pause a little while:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For bootless is the task to paint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When fancy’s self is far too faint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shew the gardener of B&mdash; &mdash;h,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In form exact, and colours true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How happy passed my early days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thee in D&mdash; &mdash;h’s groves of bays;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When slinking sly, from bush to bush,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We sought to catch the nestling thrush;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or when supported, friend, by thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I climbed the giant cherry-tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ran a race, dear Wat, with you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To please the gallant young B&mdash; &mdash;h.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bower was still, and all was hushed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">’Twas eve, and modest nature blushed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crimson setting of the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waved o’er the night-cloud’s visage dun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all creation, so serene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enjoyed the still, the lovely scene.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thrush, upon the hazel bough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pour’d calmly forth her evening vow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every bird, from tree to tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joined in the heavenly melody;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What heart so fraught with woe or care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But might have tasted pleasure there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_9" id="page_9">{9}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such, Watty, was the night when we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursued the humming bumble bee;<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you averred the beast<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> could sting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I responded, no such thing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“The question fierce, the stern reply,”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was heard to sound ’twixt U and I.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anon: my Watty dared to fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fancied foeman Wallace wight;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_10" id="page_10">{10}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, if pleasing mem’ry hold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dared to the combat, Bruce the bold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps, my friend, you’ll wish to know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Th’ event of each successive blow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How Bruce, transported, swore he’d die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never, never yield or fly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How Wallace to the combat flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fancied pride, but courage true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas! my friend, your hopes are vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For friendship still forbids the strain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tale, alas! would only tend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make a foeman of a friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whilst I live, and whilst I breathe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I swear it is so much beneath<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That I will ne’er to man disclose<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The scenes of friendship all may show.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These scenes I’ve loved, and still adore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, Oh! I love the pantry more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_41" id="page_41">{41}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">There have I sat, there have I sung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have twirled a cork, or rolled a bung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As infant fancy played her part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was a coach, this was a cart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those were the days of childish youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That promised parts, that promised truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fancy shewed herself in play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E’en in my earliest infant day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When older grown, the pantry still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was dear to me, against my will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What there was done, I may not tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It might not please your master well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So please me joy, or pierce me woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bold B&mdash; &mdash;h shall never know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough, the claret is not there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you and I both had a share.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_42" id="page_42">{42}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joy, you know, by danger bought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is always sweeter, dearer thought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regrets for past mistakes are vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pleasure often follows pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleasure is but an empty sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And surely never yet was found:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It reigns but in the poet’s brain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reality is always pain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reasoning thus, it is my plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be as merry as I can:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though they say the claret went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I don’t repine, I won’t repent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It scarcely seems a summer’s day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though years and years have past away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since in the pantry’s snug retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, at the fire, first took my seat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_43" id="page_43">{43}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! how I loved those moments dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! how your lessons pleased my ear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How oft you spoke of N&mdash; &mdash;k’s tower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgetful of the midnight hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of noble dames, of valiant knights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bloody fields, and listed fights;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ancient manners, past and fled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How S&mdash;tts, victorious, fought and bled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every combat, strife, or fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">S&mdash;tt was victorious, S&mdash;tt was right.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said I to myself, that they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall one time hear my minstrel lay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all my powers should then combine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To praise B&mdash; &mdash;h’s illustrious line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet whilst I sing the noble race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My humbler friend shall have a place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_44" id="page_44">{44}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What though the oak be grand to see?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The humbler shrub is dear to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sturdy oak unused to bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too stately looks to be my friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I’m content, and amply paid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To crouch beneath the expansive shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, wondring at the form sublime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To friendship’s heights, I dare not climb;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so I tune my humbler lays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To notes of wonder, notes of praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus the minstrel’s efforts tend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To claim a patron, not a friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In you, dear Ben, the shrub I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lowly bows his head like me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus I choose thee for my friend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For both alike are doomed to bend:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_45" id="page_45">{45}</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whilst we bend, and whilst we bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The adverse winds may rage and blow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We need not fear misfortune’s stroke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While couched beneath the stately oak:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And may that oak long live and last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That guards us from misfortune’s blast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear Ben, the oak shall have his due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If bows, and flattering praise will do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those, you know, who bow and bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne’er want a patron, or a friend.<br /></span>

<p>The subject of superstition, as connected with the history of man,
whether it be considered as influencing his character, or as affecting
his conduct in society, seems sufficiently important to occupy the
serious attention of the most learned investigator. It has been treated,
however, with so much ability by an elegant author of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_86" id="page_86">{86}</a></span> own
times,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> that, if not altogether exhausted, little more seems left to
the ingenuity of any succeeding writer, than to avail himself, as his
occasions may require, of the store of information thus amply afforded
him. No maxim being more certainly founded on truth, than that early
impressions are generally the most lasting. Would it not be highly
meritorious in any one equal to the task, to favour the public with new
editions of these invaluable productions, Satan’s Invisible World, and
Glanvil’s History of Witchcraft, rendered, on the modern and improved
plan of juvenile education, into easy ditties, to be sung or said by
nurse or child? Might we not then expect to see the pure principles of
poetic taste reared on the solid basis of useful knowledge?</p>

<p>The following marvellous occurrence, recorded in the letter of a noble
peer, and said to be founded in fact, may appear to the reader of
prosaic fancy, as extremely dull and uninteresting; but as it has been
the ground-work of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_87" id="page_87">{87}</a></span> present poem, the author cannot think of
refusing it insertion. It will likewise help to increase the volume to
that respectable size which may entitle it to the honours of Russia or
Morocco, and to a distinguished situation on the well arranged shelves
of a modern library.</p>

“MY DEAR SIR,<br />
</p>

<p>“I obey your commands with some reluctance, in relating the story
of which you have heard so much, and to which your curiosity
appears to be so broad awake. I do it unwillingly, because such
histories depend so much upon the manner in which they are related;
and this, which I have told with such success, and to the midnight
terrors of so many simple souls, will make but a sorry figure in a
written narration.&mdash;However, you shall have it.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“It was in the early part of&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;’s life, that he attended an
hunting club at their sport, when a stranger, of a genteel
appearance, and well mounted, joined the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88">{88}</a></span> chace, and was observed
to ride with a degree of courage and address that called forth the
utmost astonishment of every one present. The beast he rode was of
amazing powers; nothing stopped them; the hounds could never escape
them; and the huntsman, who was left far behind, swore that the man
and his horse were devils from hell. When the sport was over, the
company invited this extraordinary person to dinner; he accepted
the invitation, and astonished the company as much by the powers of
his conversation, and the elegance of his manners, as by his
equestrian prowess. He was an orator, a poet, a painter, a
musician, a lawyer, a divine; in short, he was every thing, and the
magic of his discourse kept the drowsy sportsmen awake long after
their usual hour. At length, however, wearied nature could be
charmed no more, and the company began to steal away by degrees to
their repose. On his observing the society diminish, he discovered
manifest signs of uneasiness: he therefore gave new force to his
spirits, and new charms to his conversation, in order to detain the
remaining few some time longer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89">{89}</a></span> This had some little effect; but
the period could not be long delayed when he was to be conducted to
his chamber. The remains of the company retired also; but they had
scarce closed their eyes, when the house was alarmed by the most
terrible shrieks that were ever heard: several persons were
awakened by the noise; but, its continuance being short, they
concluded it to proceed from a dog who might be accidentally
confined in some part of the house: they very soon, therefore,
composed themselves to sleep, and were very soon awakened by
shrieks and cries of still greater terror than the former. Alarmed
at what they heard, several of them rung their bells, and, when the
servants came, they declared that the horrid sounds proceeded from
the stranger’s chamber. Some of the gentlemen immediately arose, to
inquire into this extraordinary disturbance; and, while they were
dressing themselves for that purpose, deeper groans of despair, and
shriller shrieks of agony, again astonished and terrified them.
After knocking sometime at the stranger’s chamber-door, he answered
them as one awakened from sleep, de<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90">{90}</a></span>clared he had heard no noise,
and, rather in an angry tone, desired he might not be again
disturbed. Upon this they returned to one of their chambers, and
had scarce begun to communicate their sentiments to each other,
when their conversation was interrupted by a renewal of yells,
screams, and shrieks, which, from the horror of them, seemed to
issue from the throats of damned and tortured spirits. They
immediately followed the sounds, and traced them to the stranger’s
chamber, the door of which they instantly burst open, and found him
upon his knees in bed, in the act of scourging himself with the
most unrelenting severity, his body streaming with blood. On their
seizing his hand to stop the strokes, he begged them, in the most
wringing tone of voice, as an act of mercy, that they would retire,
assuring them that the cause of their disturbance was over, and
that in the morning he would acquaint them with the reasons of the
terrible cries they had heard, and the melancholy sight they saw.
After a repetition of his entreaties, they retired; and in the
morning some of them went to his cham<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91">{91}</a></span>ber, but he was not there;
and, on examining the bed, they found it to be one gore of blood.
Upon further inquiry, the groom said, that, as soon as it was
light, the gentleman came to the stable booted and spurred, desired
his horse might be immediately saddled, and appeared to be
extremely impatient till it was done, when he vaulted instantly
into his saddle, and rode out of the yard on full speed.&mdash;Servants
were immediately dispatched into every part of the surrounding
country, but not a single trace of him could be found; such a
person had not been seen by any one, nor has he been since heard
of.</p></div>

<p>If farther proof were necessary to shew, that the dominion of
superstition is not altogether confined, as has been erroneously
supposed, to the heroes of romance, it might be found in the learned
support afforded, but a few years ago, to the predictions of the
unfortunate Prophet Brothers: And although the sublime and simple truths
of the Christian faith have given a fatal blow to the superstitious
absurdities of more early creeds, our propensity to the marvellous, has
still retained sufficient influence, to screen from detection the
grossest impositions of the Roman Church. Among the numberless
deceptions, which Popish craft has successfully practised upon the
credulity of its votaries, one has been handed down by a venerable
historian, the insertion of which cannot fail to gratify the enlightened
commentators and note-compilers of the present age.&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Qui, cum die quadam tale aliquid foris ageret, digressis ad
ecclesiam sociis, ut dicere cœperam, et episcopus solus in oratorio
loci, lectioni vel orationi operam daret;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93">{93}</a></span> audivit repente, ut
postea referebat, vocem suavissimam cantantium atque lætantium de
cœlo ad terras usque descendere: quam videlicet vocem ab Euro
austro, id est, ab alto brumalis, exortam, primo se audisse
dicebat, ac deinde paulatim eam sibi appropiare, donec ad tectum
usque oratorii, in quo erat Episcopus, perveniret; quod ingressa
totum implevit, atque in gyro circundedit. At ille, dum solicitus
in ea quæ audiebat, animum intenderet, audivit denuo transacto
quasi dimidiæ horæ spatio, ascendere de tecto ejusdem oratorii idem
lætitiæ canticum; et ipsa qua venerat via, ad cœlos usque cum
ineffabili dulcedine, reverti. Qui cum aliquantulum horæ quasi
attonitus maneret, et quid hæc essent solerti animo scrutaretur,
aperuit Episcopus fenestram oratorii, et sonitum manu faciens, ut
sæpius consuevit, siquis foris esset, ad se intrare præcepit.
Introivit ille concitus; cui dixit antistes: vade cito ad
ecclesiam, et hos septem fratres huc venire facito; tu quoque simul
adesto. Qui cum venissent, primo admonuit eos, ut virtutem
dilectionis et pacis, ad invicem et ad omnes fideles servarent.
Instituta quoque disciplinæ<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94">{94}</a></span> regularis, quæ vel ab ipso
didicissent, vel in ipso vidissent, vel in patrum præcedentium
factis sive dictis invenissent, indefessa instantia sequerentur.
Deinde subjunxit, diem sui obitus jam proxime instare. Namque
hospes, inquit, ille amabilis, qui fratres nostros visitare
solebat, ad me quoque hodie venire, meque de seculo evocare
dignatus est. Propter quod revertentes ad ecclesiam, dicite
fratribus, ut et meum exitum Domino precibus commendent, et suum
quoque exitum, (cujus hora incerta est), vigiliis, orationibus,
bonis operibus, prævenire meminerint. Cumque hæc et hujusmodi plura
loqueretur, atque illi, percepta ejus benedictione, jam multum
tristes exiissent, rediit ipse solus, qui carmen cœleste audierat,
et prosternens se in terram, Obsecro, inquit pater, licetne aliquid
interrogare? Interroga, inquit, quod vis. At ille, Obsecro, inquit,
ut dicas, quod erat canticum illud lætantium, quod audivi,
venientium de cœlis super oratorium hoc, et post tempus redeuntium
ad cœlos. Respondit ille; Si vocem carminis audivisti, et cœlestes
supervenire cœtus cognovisti, præcipio tibi in nomine Domini, ne
hoc cuiquam, ante<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95">{95}</a></span> meum obitum, dicas. Revera autem Angelorum fuere
spiritus, qui me ad cœlestia, quæ semper amabam ac desiderabam,
præmia vocare venerunt; et post dies septem se redituros, ac me
secum adducturos esse promiserunt. Quod quidem ita ut dictum ei
erat opere completum est. Nam confestim languore corporis tactus
est, et hoc per dies ingravescente, septimo (ut promissum ei
fuerat) die, postquam obitum suum dominici corporis, et sanguinis
perceptione munivit, soluta ab ergastulo corporis anima sancta,
ducentibus (ut credi fas est), angelis comitibus, æterna gaudia
petivit.”</p>

</div>

<p>The dress of this little stranger, and his manner of introducing himself
to the festival, must satisfy the reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_96" id="page_96">{96}</a></span> that the Goblin Groom is one
of those supernatural sportsmen usually termed Fairies. In the sequel,
however, it will appear evident, that he owes his origin to the hardy
race of northern Elves, rather than to the more delicate family of
eastern Peris.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The existence of the Fairy, like that of the Mermaid, no longer rests on
the credulity of the ignorant, but is confirmed and established by
attestations no less respectable than the affidavits so frequently made
before the Lord Mayor of London, in support of the infallibility of a
quack and his nostrums.</p>

<p>In the isle of Man, where sportsmen of more tangible materials enjoy a
temporary security, these little supernaturals, probably under similar
circumstances, find an agreeable retreat. In the Minstrelsy of the
Scottish<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_97" id="page_97">{97}</a></span> Borders, on the unrefuted authority of Mr. Waldron, we have
the following interesting particulars.&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“Like the <small>FELD ELFEN</small> of the Saxons, the usual dress of the Fairies
is green; though, on the moors, they have been sometimes observed
in heath-brown, or in weeds dyed with the stoneraw, or lichen. They
often ride in invisible procession, when their presence is
discovered by the shrill ringing of their bridles. On these
occasions, they sometimes borrow mortal steeds; and when such are
found at morning, panting and fatigued in their stalls, with their
manes and tails dishevelled and entangled, the grooms, I presume,
often find this a convenient excuse for their situation; as the
common belief of the elves quaffing the choicest liquors in the
cellars of the rich, (see the story of Lord Duffus below), might
occasionally cloak the delinquencies of an unfaithful butler.</p>

<p>“The Fairies, beside their equestrian processions, are addicted, it
would seem, to the pleasures of the chace. A young sailor,
travelling by night from Douglas, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_98" id="page_98">{98}</a></span> Isle of Man, to visit his
sister, residing in Kirk Merlugh, heard the noise of horses, the
holla of a huntsman, and the sound of a horn. Immediately
afterwards, thirteen horsemen, dressed in green, and gallantly
mounted, swept past him. Jack was so much delighted with the sport,
that he followed them, and enjoyed the sound of the horn for some
miles; and it was not till he arrived at his sister’s house that he
learned the danger which he had incurred. I must not omit to
mention, that these little personages are expert jockeys, and scorn
to ride the little Manks ponies, though apparently well suited to
their size. The exercise, therefore, falls heavily upon the English
and Irish horses brought into the Isle of Man. Mr. Waldron was
assured by a gentleman of Ballafletcher, that he had lost three or
four capital hunters by these nocturnal excursions.</p>

<p>Monsieur Mallet, the learned author of the ingenious work on Northren
Antiquities, seems to consider Fairies and Elves as synonymous terms. In
his remarks on the ninth fable of the Edda, we find him thus expressing
himself.&mdash;“<span class="smcap">Alfheim</span> signifies, in Gothic, the abode of the Genii, that
is, the Fairies of the male-sex.” To prove the Gothic origin of our Elf,
we need only appeal to the devotion he shews to the bottle. His conduct
at the Dunse Festival is truly northern, and the mighty Thor<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100">{100}</a></span> himself,
the great champion of Scandinavian revelry, could not have displayed
greater zeal in emptying the enchanted horn.&mdash;But of this the reader may
judge by perusing the Gothic fable.&mdash;</p>

<p>“Then the king asked Thor, in what art he would choose to give
proof of that dexterity for which he was so famous. Thor replied,
that he would contest the prize of drinking with any person
belonging to his court. The king consented, and immediately went
into his palace to look for a large horn, out of which his
courtiers were obliged to drink when they had committed any
trespass against the customs of the court.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> This the cup-bearer
filled to the brim, and presented to Thor, whilst the king spake
thus.&mdash;Whoever is a good drinker, will<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101">{101}</a></span> empty that horn at a single
draught; some persons make two of it; but the most puny drinker of
all can do it at three. Thor looked at the horn, and was astonished
at its length;<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> however, as he was very thirsty, he set it to
his mouth, and, without drawing breath, pulled as long and as
deeply as he could, that he might not be obliged to make a second
draught of it; but when he withdrew the cup from his mouth, in
order to look in, he could scarcely perceive any of the liquor
gone. To it he went again with all his might, but succeeded no
better than before. At last, full of indignation, he again set the
horn to his lips, and exerted himself to the utmost to empty it
entirely: then looking in, he found that the liquor was a little
lowered; upon this, he resolved to attempt it no more, but gave
back the horn. I now see plainly, says the king, that thou art not
quite so stout as we thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102">{102}</a></span> thee; but art thou willing to make
any more trials? I am sure, says Thor, such draughts as I have been
drinking, would not have been reckoned small among the Gods.</p>

<p>Contrary to the custom of the Manx Fairies, it might be inferred, that
our Groom had just returned from the sanctuary of sportsmen, with a nag
of the native breed. But having already made considerable progress in
establishing the origin of the rider, we shall now take some pains in
proving to our readers the pedigree of the steed: and in asserting him
to be from the stock of the far-famed Sleipner, we hope to be borne out
by his performan<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104">{104}</a></span>ces, and confirmed by probability in our opinion. The
circumstance of that noted stallion having had eight legs, does not in
the least degree weaken our belief in the genuine descent of the
Goblin’s poney; for, reasoning by analogy, we have never yet heard of a
parent with a wooden-leg transmitting timber-toes to posterity.</p>

<p>To those sportsmen who confine their genealogical inquiries to the
general stud-book and racing-calendar, we present, in the words of the
Gothic Edda, the history of a horse, more famed than the Childer’s Barb,

<p>“Faber quidam Asas adveniens, ad urbem illis ædificandam per tres
annos sese obtulit, eamque adeo munitam, ut tuta esset ab
incursionibus Gigantum. Mercedem vero laboris Frejam postulavit, ut
et lunam solemque. Dii vero, inito consilio, paciscuntur; si vero
quid<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105">{105}</a></span> laboris prima die æstatis superesset, præmium amitteret;
nullius vero opera ei uti liceret. Hic de auxilio equi sui
Svadelfari tantum pactus fuit. Omnia vero hæc fiebant, dirigente et
instigante Locone. Hic urbam ædificaturus, noctu per equum lapides
attraxit. Asis mirum videbatur, eam tam magnos adferre montes; nec
non equum plus, quam fabrum, conficere. Pacto autem multi
interfuere testes: quippe cum gigas videretur non satis tutus inter
Asas, si hic esset, Toro domum reverso. Qui jam mari Baltico
trajecto, hinc per amnes et fluvios ad Asiam progressus, (quod
priscis Austerveg audit) bellum cum gigantibus gessit. Urbs fuit
munita et tam alta, ut perspicere non valeres. Tribus vero reliquis

quisnam auctor esset, ut Freya in Jotunheimiam elocaretur? ut et
aer perderetur, inducta cœlo calligine, sublatum solem et lunam
dando gigantibus. Illos vero inter conventum fuit, Loconem hoc
dedisse consilium. Dicebant, eum misera morte afficiendum esse,
nisi rationem, qua faber mercedem amitteret, inveniret, adjicientes
fore ut statim illum<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106">{106}</a></span> comprehenderent. Examinatus vero jurejurando

causa, cum Svadilfaro, egressuro, ex sylva prosiliit equa quædam
solitaria, equo adhinniens. Quam conspicatus equus, in furorem
actus, rupto fune, eam adcurrit, jam in sylvam accelerantem,
insequente fabro, equum assecuturo. Equa vero totam per noctem
discurrente, faber impeditus fuit, quominus, hac nocte, una cum die
sequente, opus, uti antea, fuerit continuatum. Quo cognito, animo
percellitur giganteo. Quo viso, juramentis non parcentes Torum

horse knew his. On approaching the door, I caused him to strike it
with his fore-feet; and if this did not answer my purpose, (for it
would sometimes fail), I faced him about, when, with his croup, he
would break the door in pieces: this he would accomplish in a few
moments, to the surprise and terror of the inhabitants: on the
other hand, when upon the defensive, no person could approach me
without danger; and when on the offensive, and animated at my
pleasure, to the highest pitch, he would strike in every direction,

<p>We here call upon our readers, to attend to the origin of the word Bard;
inasmuch as, that term has become applicable to poem-mongers in general.
The learned Mr. Prideaux informs us,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>“<span class="smcap">Bardus</span> possessed his father Druis’ place. To his ancestors
Phylosophy, Magick, Politicks, Rites and Ceremonies, this man added
Poetry, and set all their excellencies at a higher key. 2. From him
we have the ancient Bardi, the chroniclers of all heroick actions,
and commenders<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124">{124}</a></span> of their performers, to the imitation of their
posterity, whom an ancient poet thus bespeaketh,&mdash;</p>

<span class="i4">Then you brave Bards securely song,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">The praise of dead Pears;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In lofty strains, for to prolong<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Their fame for many years.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>3. Their esteem was such amongst the greatest commanders, that if
two armies were even at push of pike, and a Bard had step’d in
between them, they would have held their hands, harkened to their
advice, and not have offered to strike until he were out of danger.
4. Famous amongst those Bards (before the coming of our Saviour)
were held Plenidius and Glaskirion, and of late years, Davye Dee,
David ap Williams and others. They say<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125">{125}</a></span> the island Bardsey had
Bardorum Insula, its name, from them, and Aquila, Perdix, Patrick,
Maddoch, and both the Merlins the wisards, were from this
institution.”</p>

PRIDEAUX’S INTRODUCTION TO HISTORY, P. 255-256.<br />
</p></div>

<p>Although the terms Bard and Poet are those in more general use to
express the rhyme-weaving brotherhood, yet there are words of Gothic
origin which may still be found of uncommon meaning, and, on certain
occasions, even more significant than the former. Thus, a dame
declaiming in heroics to her waiting-women and children, is denominated
a Scold, from the Scalds or Poets of Iceland; and the term Bragger may,
from “Brage” of the Goths, be employed to designate a blustering
Poetaster, who claims, for alleged facility and unquestionable length of
composition, the applause reserved for creative genius and continued
exertion.</p>

derived from the Persic, through the medium of the Arabic. In Persic,
the term <i>Peri</i> expresses a species of imaginary being, which resembles
the Fairy in some of its qualities, and is one of the fairest creatures

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
